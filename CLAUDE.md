# TORQUE 360 — Automotive Workshop ERP (PRIORITY)

## Concept
Cloud-native ERP for automotive workshops in LATAM. Modules: service orders, parts inventory (WMS), CRM, invoicing, B2B marketplace (TORQUE Network).

Frontend: React + TypeScript → Vercel
Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy → Docker → Railway/Fly.io
DB: PostgreSQL + Redis
Auth: JWT + OAuth2

## Differentiation
- TORQUE Network: B2B marketplace for inter-workshop parts trading (moat)
- Modern UX vs legacy competitors (Autologica, GDS)
- Mobile responsive, cloud-native, API-first
- $200/mo vs $300-500/mo competitors
